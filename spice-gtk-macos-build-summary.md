âœ… **Successfully built** SPICE-GTK on macOS with all requested features enabled

## Enabled Features

## macOS-Specific Fixes Applied
1. Changed GTK library symbol visibility from 'hidden' to 'default' to properly export symbols
2. Created macOS-compatible symbol export files (`spice-client-gtk.symbols` and `spice-client-glib.symbols`)
3. Fixed Meson build script syntax errors (missing and extra `endif` statements)
4. Used `gthread` coroutine implementation instead of `ucontext` (which is not available on macOS)
5. Adjusted linker flags to use macOS-compatible `-Wl,-exported_symbols_list` instead of Linux version scripts

## Installation Details
- Installation prefix: `/Users/kalou/spice/install`
