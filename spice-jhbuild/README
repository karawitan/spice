This is a jhbuild moduleset to build spice (and optionally libvirt) with
smartcard support.
To use it, you first have to download and install jhbuild from
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/jhbuild
It should be a simple matter of:
git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/jhbuild.git
cd jhbuild
./autogen.sh --prefix=....
make install

More about jhbuild in the official guide:
https://developer.gnome.org/jhbuild/stable/introduction.html.en

Then you can clone this jhbuild moduleset into ~/spice:
mkdir -p ~/spice
git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-jhbuild ~/spice/spice-jhbuild
jhbuild -f ~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc

and it will build qemu with spice support and smartcard support and
spice-gtk as the spice client.

JHBuild has an option which try to install the system dependencies of
the modules you want to build:
jhbuild -f ~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc sysdeps --install

The source are downloaded into ~/spice, and the binaries installed to
~/spice-run. If you want to tweak these paths, you can edit the
~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc file, it should be self-explanatory.

In case you want to change this directories, check the jhbuildrc.

It can be run with something like:
jhbuild -f ~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc run \
qemu-system-x86_64 -vga qxl -spice port=5924,disable-ticketing \
-enable-kvm -m 512 -nographic -usbdevice tablet -cdrom ~/isos/livecd.iso

and

jhbuild -f ~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc run spicy
(spice is running on localhost:5924 with the command line above)

If you run
jhbuild -f ~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc virt-manager
libvirt and virt-manager will be built instead.
